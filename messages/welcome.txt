Congratulations!!!

You have done next step to Zen.

Zen Tabs is a Sublime Text 2/3 plugin that helps you to keep you tab bar in Zen.

You have to do nothing now. You just need to set opened tabs limit to 10(default) or even to 1 and enjoy. When you will open [limited_tabs_count + 1] tab the oldest one will be closed. That's all. 

New features are comming up!
